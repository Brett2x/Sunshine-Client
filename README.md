# Sunshine Client
## What actually is this?
Sunshine was originally a fabric 1.20.1 client made in early - mid 2023. (A few months ago i ported it to 1.21.1 but I haven't
added anything else to it at all since roughly July 2023 so it just laid dormant on my drive)

it was originally made to bypass the grim anticheat, although most of the bypasses were just abusing the 1.17+ duplicate
packet exploit. Despite this, it did have a few cool bypasses for it's time: the first ever grim velocity 0/0 to my knowledge
(found by Baldo), the grim TNT fly (which is patched now from what I know), a weird grim fly exploit accidentally found by me
a few years ago which I think i have seen in a few more recent videos so it might actually still work, etc.

The codebase is super weird from what I remember (I haven't actually taken a good look at it before posting this) due to 
three people of varying skill levels contributing code (Wykt who made the base, baldo who added some bypasses and 
modules and myself who did the same, despite not being too good with programming by that point).
